## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = storms) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = pressure, y = wind), color = "green", alpha = 0.5)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
